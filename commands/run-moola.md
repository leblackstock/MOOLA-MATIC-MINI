Run Mode (copy/paste to start a run; tells Cursor to use Run mode)

/run-moola
Enter Run mode for MOOLA-MATIC.
Run MOOLA-MATIC on the attached item(s). Default to Identify+Value unless I say "List".
If I say "List", create the JSON file and respond with:
JSON file created.
Prioritize auto-fill fields used by ListPerfectly selectors first.
After a List run, open the Playwright UI and load the generated JSON file.
Include estimated measurements in the initial JSON output; the UI only edits.

Inputs I will provide:

- Photos and/or item details
- COGS (acquisition cost)
- Any known measurements or condition notes
