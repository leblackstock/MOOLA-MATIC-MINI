MOOLA-MATIC JSON SCHEMA.txt

QUICK REFERENCE
- LIST mode only; include JSON by default unless user says "no JSON".
- Do NOT display raw JSON unless user explicitly asks to see it.
- Create JSON file and output a single download line.
- Use empty strings or empty arrays instead of guessing.
- Keep field types exact (arrays stay arrays, strings stay strings).

NOTES / COMMON MISTAKES
- Do NOT print the JSON in chat; only output the JSON download line.
- Do NOT add extra keys beyond the schema list.
- Arrays must be arrays (never empty strings). Use [] for empty lists.
- "quantity" must be the string "1", not a number.
- "condition_status" must be exactly "New" or "Pre-Owned" if known.
- "intended_for" must be an array of allowed values (even if only one).
- "platforms" must be an array of {"platform":"...","reason":"..."} objects.
- "shipping_zip" defaults to "30236" if not provided.
- "notes" must be exactly "<purchase_date> Purchased from <purchase_location>" or blank.
- Do NOT use labels like "Condition:" or "Platforms:" in any sentence fields.
- Do NOT include platform lines inside "listing_body" or "listperfectly_description".

JSON OUTPUT (LIST MODE ONLY)
- Create the JSON file (if the project supports file creation).
- Output a single plain-text download line only (must be clickable):
  Download the JSON: <YYYYMMDD-HHMM>_<Title>.json
- Filename rules:
  Use date/time first, then Title, separated by underscores. Do NOT include SKU.
  Date/time format uses local time: YYYYMMDD-HHMM.
  Replace spaces with dashes, remove commas/quotes, and collapse multiple dashes.

JSON FILE CONTENT (EXACT)
- The JSON file must be a single JSON object with these keys (always include all keys):
  title, hook, description, included_items, measurements, measurements_imperial, measurements_metric, tags_line, tags, condition, cta,
  pricing_sentence, free_shipping_price, buyer_pays_shipping_price, shipping_estimate_sentence,
  shipping_cost_estimate, offer_recommendation, time_to_sell_sentence, platforms, types_block, listing_body,
  listperfectly_description, question,
  sku, quantity, cogs, upc, brand, color, material, size_or_fit, style_features, country_of_origin, msrp, era_status, era_notes, style_tags,
  condition_status, intended_for, shipping_weight_lb, shipping_weight_oz,
  package_length, package_width, package_height, shipping_zip,
  purchase_date, purchase_location, notes

FIELD TYPES (STRICT)
- Strings: title, hook, description, tags_line, condition, cta, pricing_sentence, shipping_estimate_sentence, offer_recommendation, time_to_sell_sentence,
  types_block, listing_body, listperfectly_description, question, sku, quantity, cogs, upc, brand, color, material, size_or_fit,
  style_features, country_of_origin, msrp, era_status, era_notes, condition_status, shipping_weight_lb, shipping_weight_oz, package_length, package_width, package_height,
  shipping_zip, purchase_date, purchase_location, notes, shipping_cost_estimate, free_shipping_price, buyer_pays_shipping_price.
- Arrays of strings: included_items, measurements, measurements_imperial, measurements_metric, tags, intended_for, style_tags.
- Arrays of objects: platforms (each object has "platform" and "reason" strings).

  - No title line
