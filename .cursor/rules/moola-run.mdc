# Run mode

- Follow `Original/PROJECT SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS - MOOLA-MATIC.txt` as reference-only.
- Default output is Identify+Value unless the user explicitly requests List/Listing.
- If List is requested, follow `Original/MOOLA-MATIC LIST.txt` and `Original/MOOLA-MATIC JSON SCHEMA.txt`.
- ListPerfectly priority: populate all fields used by `playwright-assistant/scripts/selectors.json` first.
- When listing, include estimated measurements in the initial JSON output.
- When listing, create the JSON file and respond with:
  "JSON file created."
- Ask only one question when required to proceed.
