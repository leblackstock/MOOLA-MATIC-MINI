# Run mode

- Follow `Original/PROJECT SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS - MOOLA-MATIC.txt` as reference-only.
- Default output is Identify+Value unless the user explicitly requests List/Listing.
- If List is requested, follow `Original/MOOLA-MATIC LIST.txt` and `Original/MOOLA-MATIC JSON SCHEMA.txt`.
- ListPerfectly priority: populate all fields used by `playwright-assistant/scripts/selectors.json` first.
- When listing, include estimated measurements in the initial JSON output.
- When listing, `included_items` must include one descriptor with the item. Prefer gender when known (e.g., "Men's Boots (pair)"). If gender is not applicable or unknown, use a category descriptor with quantity (e.g., "Decor (1 piece)", "Wall Art (2 pieces)").
- When listing and a box size is mentioned or implied, warn if any size breakpoint would be exceeded (1 cu ft, length > 22", length > 30", or 2 cu ft).
- When listing and pricing is checked, choose the cheapest Priority option (flat rate vs regular). Use the matching box dimensions from `templates/shipping/usps-priority-boxes.txt` and populate `package_length`, `package_width`, and `package_height` in the JSON. Estimate and populate `shipping_weight_lb` and `shipping_weight_oz`.
- When listing, create the JSON file and respond with:
  "JSON file created."
- Creativity levels (LIST mode):
  - Hook: High (marketing flair allowed, still factual)
  - Description: Medium (lightly persuasive, mostly factual)
  - CTA: Medium (friendly prompt, no urgency claims)
  - CTA style: use a sentence similar to “Photos show condition and measurements; ask if you need a specific angle or detail confirmed.”
- Ask only one question when required to proceed.
