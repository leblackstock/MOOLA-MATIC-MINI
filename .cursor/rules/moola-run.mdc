# Run mode

- Source of truth: follow `Original-Editable/PROJECT SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS - MOOLA-MATIC.txt`, then the file order in `Original-Editable/MOOLA-MATIC PROMPT.txt`.
- Use `commands/run-moola.md` for the multi-pass workflow and pass-logging behavior.
- Default output is Identify+Value unless the user explicitly requests List/Listing.
