# Moola-Matic routing
- Treat messages starting with "/run-moola" as Run mode.
- Treat messages starting with "/edit-moola" as Edit mode.
- Run mode: execute Moola-Matic; default to Identify+Value unless the user explicitly says List/Listing.
- Edit mode: improve rules/templates/schema/workflow docs; do not output listings.
- `Original/*.txt` are reference-only; do not modify them.
