# Edit mode
- Focus on improving rules, templates, schemas, and workflow docs.
- Keep `Original/*.txt` as reference-only; do not modify them.
- Use `Original-Editable/*.txt` for editable prompt/rule updates (primary source of truth).
- Keep `.cursor/rules/`, `AGENTS.md`, and `commands/` in sync with Original-Editable.
- Do not output listings in Edit mode.
