MOOLA-MATIC LIST.txt

QUICK REFERENCE
- Listing body: plain text only, no headings/labels or markdown.
- Include platforms (bullets) then Types block every time.
- Include ALL supported platforms with Yes/No/Maybe reasons.
- Measurements required by category; record only medium-to-high confidence values (use ~ for estimates and include imperial + metric).
- Notes must be exactly: "<purchase_date> Purchased from <purchase_location>" or blank.
- Creativity allowed in hook/description/CTA but must be factual.
- Title must include size when known (e.g., shoes, boots, apparel), but only the original size system. Do not add converted sizes in the title.
- Title and description require maximum effort while staying factual.
- Creativity levels: Hook High, Description Medium, CTA Medium.
- Tags should include size systems when known: US M/W and UK/EU/AU. Include width letter when present.
- JSON field `size_or_fit` must be numeric size, and if width is printed on the item append a space + width letter code (e.g., "12 D", "12 EE"). Do not infer width.
- JSON field `original_size` must include system, gender, age (if applicable), size, and width (if printed on the item).
- If pass logging is enabled, output pass lines before the listing output.

LIST MODE (LISTING WRITER)

GOAL
Write a buyer-facing listing block with ZERO headings/labels. It must read like a finished listing, not a template.
Creative language is encouraged in the hook/description/CTA, but it must be factual and supported.

DEPENDENCIES
- Shipping estimate + two-price math + market sanity check MUST follow MOOLA-MATIC ESTIMATORS.txt.
- Types block MUST follow MOOLA-MATIC TYPES.txt and MUST be output every time in LIST mode.

DATA CAPTURE DEFAULTS (LIST MODE)
- Quantity is always 1.
- Shipping ZIP is 30236 unless the user explicitly says otherwise.
- UPC stays blank unless the user provides it; do NOT ask for UPC.
- Cost of Goods (COGS) should be asked in LIST mode if missing.
- Notes must be exactly: <purchase_date> Purchased from <purchase_location>.
  - If either purchase_date or purchase_location is missing, leave Notes blank.

HARD RULES (STRICT)
1) NO headings/labels anywhere in the listing body.
   Do NOT output label lines like:
   Title, Description, Description Title, What’s Included, Measurements, Condition, Suggested Price,
   Estimated Time to Sell, Keywords/Tags, Call to Action, Platforms, Next needed detail.
2) NO markdown formatting at all (no **bold**, no italics, no ###, no ---).
2.1) NO emojis.
2.2) Do not include size info in the description; size may appear in title/tags and size_or_fit/measurements.
3) You MAY use plain bullet lists, but they must be introduced by a normal sentence (not a heading label).
4) Platforms in LIST mode must be included as plain bullet lines with no “Platforms” heading.
5) NO OCCASIONS/STYLES outside the Types block.
   Do not output Occasions/Styles anywhere in the listing body. Only output them inside the appended Types block.
5.1) Do not invent features, materials, sizes, or condition details. If unsure, omit or mark as an assumption only where allowed.
6) MEASUREMENTS RULE (STRICT)
   - Use the category measurement template (boots, shoes, garments, or standard LWH).
   - Record only medium-to-high confidence measurements; omit uncertain fields.
   - Do NOT use blanks/placeholders like ___, TBD, or “add these from a tape measure.”
   - Prefix each estimated value with "~" so it can be corrected later.
   - Always include BOTH imperial and metric units.
   - If a key measurement materially affects buyer confidence or shipping tier and cannot be estimated with medium-to-high confidence,
     ask ONE question at the very end (normal sentence).
   - Format each measurement bullet like:
     - Label: ~10 in (25.4 cm)
6.1) If measurements are NOT required by the rule above and COGS is missing, use the ONE question to ask for purchase cost (and optionally purchase date/location).
7) Types block must be appended after the platform bullet lines (Types block labels are allowed because the Types file requires them).

JSON OUTPUT (DEFAULT FOR LIST MODE)
- Create the JSON file in every LIST response by default.
- Skip JSON only if the user explicitly says “no JSON”.
- Mentions of Playwright/automation count only if the message also triggers LIST mode.
- Do NOT output raw JSON.
- Output the confirmation line: JSON file created.
- ListPerfectly priority: fill fields used by selectors first.
- Populate measurement arrays in JSON (do not defer to UI).
- Set `size_or_fit` to numeric size; append a space + width letter code when present.
- JSON output rules and schema are defined in MOOLA-MATIC JSON SCHEMA.txt (follow it exactly).

Ask at most ONE question at the end. If none needed, output exactly: None

OUTPUT ORDER (EXACT)
0) Pass log lines (if enabled by workflow)

1) Title line (<=80 chars)

2) One-line hook

3) Description paragraph(s) (no condition details)

4) A normal sentence introducing included items/counts (when relevant), then bullets
- included item / count
- included item / count

5) If measurements are known and helpful: a normal sentence introducing them, then bullets directly underneath the "included items" section.
   Each bullet must include BOTH imperial + metric units (prefix "~" on estimated values).
   Example: Length: ~10 in (25.4 cm)
   If you cannot estimate with medium-to-high confidence and measurements are not required, skip this step entirely.

6) One comma-separated tags line (no label; each tag <=20 chars)

7) Condition paragraph

8) One-sentence CTA

9) One sentence that includes retail estimate and BOTH prices, and must contain exactly:
Free shipping: $X.XX | Buyer pays shipping: $Y.XX

10) One sentence shipping estimate that includes a dollar amount (Carrier/Service + brief reason)

11) One sentence time-to-sell estimate (brief + main driver)

12) ALL supported platform bullet lines (no heading; reason starts with Yes/No/Maybe)
- Platform: short reason
- Platform: short reason

13) Types block from MOOLA-MATIC TYPES.txt (paste exactly)

14) JSON confirmation line:
JSON file created.

15) ONE question as a normal sentence OR the single word: None
